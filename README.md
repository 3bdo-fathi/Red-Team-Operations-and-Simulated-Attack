# 🛡️ Red Team Operations and Simulated Attack

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on executing a **simulated cyber-attack** on a network environment using **Red Team methodologies**. The goal is to assess and enhance the target system's **incident response capabilities**, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend improvements to strengthen security posture.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Simulate real-world attack scenarios to test security defenses.  
- Uncover weaknesses in network infrastructure and controls.  
- Deliver actionable insights to improve overall security resilience.
